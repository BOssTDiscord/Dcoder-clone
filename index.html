After some time, he found a former colleague of his, Aaron, who was a spy just like him and that brought back some memories. He tried to contact him but he ran away, so Bourne placed a tracker on him. After a while, Aaron found the tracker and ditched it. Meanwhile, Bourne was analysing his moving patterns on a graph and found that he still followed an old trick to lose followers. All spies were given a list of numbers, arr, which expanded back to coordinates(latitude and longitude) using a decryption technique. Let us assume your current position is x, now you can go to position arr[x] and then to position arr[arr[x]] and henceforth. These help to keep your movements random. Now Bourne obviously knows his starting position and needs to catch up on him.
